    intro:
      "Side effects vary by treatment. Some are short-lived; others need ongoing support. Tell your team early rather than waiting for the next scheduled visit if you are worried.",
    paragraphs: [
      "Surgery can affect movement, sensation and body image. Radiotherapy may cause skin redness and tiredness. Chemotherapy can cause nausea, infection risk, hair loss and fatigue. Hormone therapy may affect joints, mood or menopausal symptoms.",
      "Supportive care can include medicines for nausea, physiotherapy, nutrition advice and psychological support. Scalp cooling is used in some centres for selected chemotherapy regimens; it is not suitable for everyone and is not confirmed as available here unless your hospital states it.",

      "WHO emphasises that psychosocial, mental health, nutritional and physical support can help people complete treatment. Ask about counselling, specialist nursing support and trusted patient organisations.",

      "Follow-up may include clinical reviews and recommended imaging. Report new breast, chest or other persistent symptoms rather than waiting for a routine appointment if you are concerned.",
      "Rehabilitation can help with arm movement, fatigue, scar care and fitness. Nutrition and gentle activity, as advised by your team, often form part of longer-term wellbeing.",
      "Survivorship is not a single moment. Some people feel well quickly; others need months of adjustment. Ask about late effects, work, fertility and sexual health if they matter to you.",
